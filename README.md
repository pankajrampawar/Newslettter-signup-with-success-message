## Overview

To solve the challenge I used basic react, from react I use React.useState and React.useEffect hook for proper DOM manipulation and button responsiveness. The challenging part was the use of react-rotuer-dom, i used two different locations for different components of the page, the first part being landing page and the second part being success page.

I have not included the actual mail confirmation procedure as this challenge was purely based on my frontend skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
